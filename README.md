This ðŸšœ   Predicts the sale price of Bulldozers using machine learning

The goal is predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

## 1. Problem definition
> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar

## 2. Data
The data is in local disk also at kaggle.com

## 3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this project is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) b/w the actual price and the predicted aution price

Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal here will be to build a ML model which minimizes RMSLE

## 4. Features
 Are found in data dictionary or kaggle.com
